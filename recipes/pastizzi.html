    <h4>Pastizzi (singular is pastizz) are a small pastry made with a crisp flaky dough and typically stuffed with fillings like ricotta cheese, mushy peas or chicken.</h4>
    <p>
        This recipe is very easy and you can enjoy some freshly baked pastizzi within about 30 minutes of starting the recipe (provided you’ve defrosted your phyllo dough already!).
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Ricotta filling</li>
            <li>1 cup ricotta light or full fat</li>
            <li>1 egg lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1/4 chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 handful parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 sheets puff pastry</li>
            <li>Curried Pea filling:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 small onion</li>
                <li>3/4 cup dried split peas</li>
                <li>1 tsp mild curry powder</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>For the Ricotta filling:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix all ingredients in a bowl (except the puff pastry) and set aside until ready to use.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>For the Curried Pea filling:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the peas well, picking through and discarding any irregular bits. Bring the peas and plenty of water (fill about 2″ above the peas) to the boil. Reduce heat and simmer gently for 35 minutes until the peas are very tender. Meanwhile, saute the onion until very soft, but not browned. Strain the peas to remove most of the excess liquid (not all). Mix in the onions, curry powder, salt and pepper.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Putting it all together</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
                <li>Thaw puff pastry (or, thaw before starting, depending on your preferred brand’s instructions). Cut 3″ circles using an overturned glass or biscuit cutter.</li>
                <li>Fill each circle with a small teaspoon of the ricotta or pea mixture. Fold one side of the circle into the middle, then the other, folding over at the top to seal. Then, pinch each end to seal, and if desired, twist once. Don’t worry too much about how they look when the pastry is still raw. The puffiness will hide any imperfections. You do want to make sure they are secure however or they might puff open.</li>
                <li>Place the pastizzi on a lined baking sheet, and bake 20 minutes until the dough is puffed and golden. Cool on a wire rack and serve immediately. Or, reheat later in a 180C / 350F oven for 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
